# shell-scripts

Basic shell scripts that leverage SEMP, Solace's management API, to interact with client usernames stored in a Solace router's internal database.

These scripts do not read from any configuration files. You'll need to modify the Solace connection details in each script that you want to use. You'll see a clearly labeled section in each script where you need to sub in your router's details.
